# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Tasks
### 0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library

### 1. Combining descriptions

### 3. Spies
- Spies are a useful wrapper that will execute the wrapped function, and log useful information (e.g. was it called, with what arguments). Sinon is a library allowing you to create spies.

### 4. Stubs
- Stubs are similar to spies. Except that you can provide a different implementation of the function you are wrapping. Sinon can be used as well for stubs.

### 5. Hooks
- Hooks are useful functions that can be called before execute one or all tests in a suite

### 6. Async tests with done
- Look into how to support async testing, for example when waiting for the answer of an API or from a Promise

### 7. Skip
- When you have a long list of tests, and you canâ€™t figure out why a test is breaking, avoid commenting out a test, or removing it. Skip it instead, and file a ticket to come back to it as soon as possible

### 8. Basic Integration testing

### 9. Regex integration testing

### 10. Deep equality & Post integration testing
